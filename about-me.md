Hi! My name is Alvaro. I'm an Electrical Engineer living in Sunnyvale, CA. My main interests include electronics, flying, photography(time-lapse and high-speed), and traveling. My videos can be seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/apg88">here</a> and photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/apg88/sets/">here</a>. While photos and videos are in other sites, this one contains my blog. You can read about some of <a href="http://alvarop.com/category/travel/">my travels</a>, about <a href="http://alvarop.com/category/projects/">my projects</a>, and <a href="http://alvarop.com/category/random/">other stuff</a>.
