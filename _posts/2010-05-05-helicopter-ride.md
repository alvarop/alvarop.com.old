So after lunch today, we heard a helicopter flying overhead. I was told that it was the USMC doing flights if you did 10+ pull-ups. I decided to head over since I had never been in a helicopter before. When I arrived, they told me that anyone can take a ride, but if you can do at least 15 pull ups, you get to skip the (very long) line.

Unfortunately I am not that strong and only managed to do 11. Since I had talked to the Staff Sargent there before, I got to jump ahead a bit.

The actual ride was a lot of fun. We flew around campus a few times, and since the girl sitting up front had a nice camera, the pilot decided to fly sideways so she could get some nice photos. I'm definitely going to try that again next time they do the rides. I managed to get a video of it:
