So it rained a lot on Saturday... It was sunny on Sunday and today. I arrived to work around 8:30am and saw several puddles on the ground. I figured that was nothing and waited for the rest of the people to arrive. When they did, the supervisors said to come back at 2:30pm. I went back home, listened to some music, ate my lunch, and went on the computer.<br /><br />I then went to work and found nothing cool. After work I went home again and had some dinner. Now I'm here talking to my friend from Kazakhstan on Skype, which is totally awesome because I hadn't talked to her in a while. And she also helped me write some emails in Russian, so I don't mess up too bad.
