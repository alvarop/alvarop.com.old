I made a remote trigger using an MCT6 Optocoupler, some buttons, LED's, and 2.5mm stereo jack.<br />This will hopefully be able to connect to a microcontroller to take pictures at set intervals. By using the 2.5mm connector, this device should also work with the Canon EOS DSLR cameras. (Which I don't have, but I'll find one to test this on...)
</p>

<p>
Here are some details...
</p>

I had to remove about 15 screws, disconnect several ribbon-cables, and use more force than I am comfortable with with circuit boards. Eventually I got to the shutter button.

When you press the button down lightly, the camera focuses, and once you press it all the way down, it takes the picture.  I used my multimeter to figure out which pins did what. I figured out that there one pin is connected to ground, the second to the focus trigger and the third to the shutter trigger.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_k2p8q4xyXYc/S6u5CmbbQCI/AAAAAAAAAGE/5i1GhvdkUJc/s1600/IMG_0769.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 221px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_k2p8q4xyXYc/S6u5CmbbQCI/AAAAAAAAAGE/5i1GhvdkUJc/s320/IMG_0769.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5452655228188573730" border="0" /></a>Once I soldered some very thin wires to the button pins I spent some time putting the camera back together. I had to make a small hole in the top so the wires wouldn't be cut by the front cover.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_k2p8q4xyXYc/S6u5C46QsyI/AAAAAAAAAGM/IOeAhP0rXfU/s1600/IMG_0777.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 287px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_k2p8q4xyXYc/S6u5C46QsyI/AAAAAAAAAGM/IOeAhP0rXfU/s320/IMG_0777.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5452655233149743906" border="0" /></a>Once I closed it, I soldered the wires to a 2.5mm female stereo connector. This is also used by the Canon DSLRs, so I figured it was a good idea to use it, since I'm planning to upgrade. I also used some heat-shrink tube to protect the tiny wires from breaking too easily.

I used an MCT6 optocoupler from Fairchild Semiconductors to isolate the camera from the rest of the circuit. I then connected two button/switches that I found lying around, two resistors, and two LED's to show when each is enabled. The bottom cable assembly with three wires coming out is a 2.5mm male stereo jack that connects to the camera. The left red/white wires come from a homemade 5V power supply.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_k2p8q4xyXYc/S6u5DQS0ANI/AAAAAAAAAGU/kEeLjzY7dBA/s1600/IMG_0780.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_k2p8q4xyXYc/S6u5DQS0ANI/AAAAAAAAAGU/kEeLjzY7dBA/s320/IMG_0780.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5452655239426736338" border="0" /></a>The full setup can be seen here. The circuit on the right is just a 5V regulator with some filtering capacitors I use for various projects.
</p>

<p>
The main goal of this project was to test the optocoupler and circuit before I test it with a much more expensive DSLR. I also wanted to see what was inside my old digital camera. Now that this works, I can connect it to a microcontroller and use it for long term time-lapse shots.

<p>
Here is a [bad]video of me explaining how it works.

This is the picture that was taken while making the video. The camera in the background on the gorillapod was recording the video.
