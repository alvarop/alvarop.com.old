One partof the lake.

There are tons of lakes in Finland. Lake Suolijärvi is nearest to where I live. Several international students decided to have a BBQ by the lake and go swimming, so we headed over around 9pm. I don’t remember if I went swimming that time, but we go there a lot. The first time I was there was with some coworkers.</p>

Not sure what they were doing with the grill here...

People brought their own charcoal grills along with some one-time use grills (which I had never seen before.)

We went home sometime after 11pm.<a href="/images/blgr/IMG_1538.JPG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 267px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_k2p8q4xyXYc/TD9QgVwVFdI/AAAAAAAAAJE/rZNEP0BBBv0/s400/IMG_1538.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5494198586941183442" border="0" /></a>

There was one group of students from Mexico.
