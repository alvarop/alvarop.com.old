It's almost been a year since I set up this blog. I kind of stopped writing after I arrived from Russia.
So far I have mostly been doing schoolwork and things like that.
I did work on a fun little project though, I think I will write about how it all came to be later.
Here is a picture of the end result:

 <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/images/blgr/HPIM2603.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_k2p8q4xyXYc/SAfWYla8lwI/AAAAAAAAAAc/MXtMauyS9RM/s320/HPIM2603.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5190352813418125058" border="0" /></a>

 Aside from that, nothing of much interest has happened.

 Maybe I'll just stick to writing about small things like the project. Unless my life gets more interesting, that's all I will have to write about!
